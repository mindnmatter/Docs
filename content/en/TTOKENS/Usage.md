description: 'T-Tokens are tokenized cryptocurrencies by Thirm VM. Each T-Token is 100% verifiable and backed by its native cryptocurrency (e.g., 1 tBTC = 1 BTC). T-Tokens can be used like any normal ERC20 token, which means they will work in all Ethereum Based Applications. They can be locked, lent, borrowed, traded, or used in more complex logics.'
