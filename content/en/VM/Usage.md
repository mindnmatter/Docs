VM works with protocol smart contracts, as a user you do not have access to VM. You just request actions on smart contracts and then VM will pick them if they are valid.

This modularity makes the THIRM PROTOCOL avoid hacks and spam attacks since requesting action on smart contract costs gas and a spam is not possible since it will cost spammer a lot money, preventing a spam attack on THIRM PROTOCOL.
